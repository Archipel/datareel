In RHEL6/CENTOS6 and RHEL7/CENTOS7 the default number of file,
including sockets, is 1024. For load balancer applications with a high
volume of connections you may need to increase the default value. 

For RHEL7/CENTOS7, the global ulimit for nofiles is ignored for
systemd services. The nofile limit is now set in the service file:

# more /etc/systemd/system/drlb_server.service

[Service]
LimitNOFILE=65535

For RHEL6/CENTOS6, you can increase the max number of open files by
increasing the ulimit value:

# vi /etc/security/limits.d/nofile.conf

*    soft    nofile 32767
*    hard    nofile 65535


This change will require a reboot. To test without rebooting:

# ps -ef | grep drlb_server | grep -v grep
# prlimit --pid <pid> --nofile=32767:65535
